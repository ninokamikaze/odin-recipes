        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</br>
        Reserve 3/4 cup of apple pie filling and set aside. Spoon remaining pie filling into crust.</br>
        Combine cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl; beat until smooth. Add eggs and mix well; pour over apple filling in crust.</br>
        Bake in the preheated oven until edges are puffed and surface of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature.</br>
        To make the caramel apple topping: Mix reserved apple filling and caramel sauce in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 1 minute.</br>
        Arrange apple slices around outside edge of cooled cheesecake. Spread caramel sauce evenly on top; decorate with pecan halves around edge. Sprinkle with chopped pecans. Chill until ready to serve.
